// Shooting-on-the-fly concept:
// The current way that we manage shooting-on-the fly endeavors to be reasonably
// simple, until we get a chance to see how the actual dynamics play out.
// Essentially, we assume that the robot's velocity will represent a constant
// offset to the ball's velocity over the entire trajectory to the goal and
// then offset the target that we are pointing at based on that.
// Let us assume that, if the robot shoots while not moving, regardless of shot
// distance, the ball's average speed-over-ground to the target will be a
// constant s_shot (this implies that if the robot is driving straight towards
// the target, the actual ball speed-over-ground will be greater than s_shot).
// We will define things in the robot's coordinate frame. We will be shooting
// at a target that is at position (target_x, target_y) in the robot frame. The
// robot is travelling at (v_robot_x, v_robot_y). In order to shoot the ball,
// we need to generate some virtual target (virtual_x, virtual_y) that we will
// shoot at as if we were standing still. The total time-of-flight to that
// target will be t_shot = norm2(virtual_x, virtual_y) / s_shot.
// we will have virtual_x + v_robot_x * t_shot = target_x, and the same
// for y. This gives us three equations and three unknowns (virtual_x,
// virtual_y, and t_shot), and given appropriate assumptions, can be solved
// analytically. However, doing so is obnoxious and given appropriate functions
// for t_shot may not be feasible. As such, instead of actually solving the
// equation analytically, we will use an iterative solution where we maintain
// a current virtual target estimate. We start with this estimate as if the
// robot is stationary. We then use this estimate to calculate t_shot, and
// calculate the next value for the virtual target.
