## Introduction

AOS ("Autonomous Operating System") is an open source event-loop based framework for
realtime robotic systems. It is meant to serve the same role as
[ROS](https://www.ros.org/) in a robotic system (including the fact that, like
ROS, it is not actually an Operating System). However, the design priorities of
AOS are somewhat different from those of both ROS and ROS2. See the [Design of
AOS](design) for more detail.

## Contributing

[aos](https://github.com/RealtimeRoboticsGroup/aos)
is the canonical GitHub mirror of the
AOS code. Issues or feature requests can be reported using the GitHub issues page
(this is subject to change); however, contributions to AOS are made through a
Gerrit server at [https://realtimeroboticsgroup.org/gerrit/](https://realtimeroboticsgroup.org/gerrit/).
Access to the Gerrit server is granted through your github credentials.  Only authorized users can trigger CI/CD.
Contact Austin Schuh if you would like to make contributions there.
