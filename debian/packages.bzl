# In order to use deb packages in the build you have to follow these steps.
#
# Adding new packages:
# 1. Create a "download_packages" build step in //debian/BUILD. List the
#    packages you care about and exclude the ones you don't care about.
#    Invoke "bazel run" on the "download_packages" target you just created.
#    Save the "_files" dictionary it prints into a .bzl file in the //debian
#    folder. You will need to have the apt-rdepends package installed.
#    If you want to get packages for a different architecture or distribution,
#    you can pass flags here to control those. See the --help for details.
# 2. The "download_packages" steps prints the location of the deb packages
#    after it prints the "_files" dictionary. Take the deb packages from there
#    and upload them to https://realtimeroboticsgroup.org/build-dependencies/.
# 3. Add the newly uploaded deb packages as WORKSPACE entries using the
#    "generate_repositories_for_debs" helper. Load the "_files" dictionary
#    created earlier and the "generate_repositories_for_debs" helper and call
#    them together in the WORKSPACE file.
# 4. Add a "generate_deb_tarball" target to //debian/BUILD. Pass in the
#    "_files" dictionary created earlier by loading it from the .bzl file.
# 5. Invoke "bazel build" on the "generate_deb_tarball" target you just created
#    and upload the resulting tarball to https://realtimeroboticsgroup.org/build-dependencies.
# 6. Add a new "new_http_archive" entry to the WORKSPACE file for the tarball
#    you just uploaded.
#
# Updating existing packages:
# 1. Read above instructions.
# 2. The "download_packages" build step already exists, run it.
# 3. The .bzl file with the file list already exists.  Update it with the
#    output from the previous step.
# 4. Follow steps 2., 5., and 6. from "adding new packages".
