      name: Name of the generated ts_library rule.
      srcs: Source .fbs file(s).
      deps: Other flatbuffer_ts_library's to depend on. Note that currently
            you must specify all your transitive dependencies manually.
      include_paths: Optional, list of paths the includes files can be found in.
      flatc_args: Optional list of additional arguments to pass to flatc
          (e.g. --gen-mutable).
      visibility: The visibility of the generated cc_library. By default, use the
          default visibility of the project.
      compatible_with: Optional, The list of environments this rule can be built
        for, in addition to default-supported environments.
      restricted_to: Optional, The list of environments this rule can be built
        for, instead of default-supported environments.
      target_compatible_with: Optional, The list of target platform constraints
        to use.
      include_reflection: Optional, Whether to depend on the flatbuffer
        reflection library automatically. Only really relevant for the
        target that builds the reflection library itself.
      package_name: Optional, Package name to use for the generated code.
